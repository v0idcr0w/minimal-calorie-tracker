# Minimal Calorie and Macronutrient Tracker

By default only meals of the current day are displayed in the Meals tab. You can use the toggle button to override this behavior, keeping the some or all of the meals the same. This is particularly useful if you tend to eat the same types of food every day with only minor changes in quantity.

<!-- <p>A new recipe can be built from the information found in the Foods menu. The difference is that you can use your new recipe inside your meals. As the name suggests, you can use this section to enter custom recipes - such as a home-made cake - just make sure to properly weight your ingredients. Alternatively, you can use a custom-recipe to alliviate the painful job of having to re-enter the same foods if you tend to eat the same combinations of foods every day.</p> -->
